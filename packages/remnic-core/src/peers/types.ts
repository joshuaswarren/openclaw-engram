 * Peer registry types — issue #679 PR 1/5.

 * "self" — is represented as a `Peer` with an evolving cognitive profile.
 *
 * This module defines pure types only. Storage primitives live in
 * `./storage.ts`. Reasoner integration, recall injection, CLI/HTTP/MCP
 * surfaces, and migration of existing identity-anchor data ship in later
 * PRs (2/5 — 5/5).

 * - `integration` — non-conversational integration (cron, webhook, importer).
