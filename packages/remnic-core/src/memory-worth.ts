/**
 * Issue #560 PR 2 — Memory Worth scoring (pure helper).
 *
 * Given per-memory outcome counters (`mw_success`, `mw_fail` — added to
 * frontmatter in PR 1), compute a scalar worth score plus interpretable
 * metadata. The score is a Laplace-smoothed success probability with an
 * optional recency decay, and is meant to be used as a multiplier on existing
 * recall scores (PR 4) to sink memories that consistently lead to failed
 * sessions and keep uninstrumented memories at a neutral baseline.
 *
 * Intentional properties:
 *   - Pure function. No I/O, no time-of-import side effects. Testable in
 *     isolation; callers pass `now` so tests don't depend on the wall clock.
 *   - Laplace-smoothed ratio `(s + 1) / (s + f + 2)` ensures a memory with
 *     zero observations scores exactly 0.5 — neither boosted nor penalized.
 *     A single failure on a new memory lands at 1/3, not 0, so one bad
 *     session doesn't permanently exile a fact.
 *   - Recency decay is optional. When a memory hasn't been touched in a long
 *     time, its `p_success` is pulled back toward 0.5 (the prior). Decay is
 *     exponential with an operator-configured half-life so old verdicts
 *     aren't treated as equally informative as fresh ones.
 *   - Corrupt / missing inputs fail safely to the prior. Callers upstream of
 *     this helper (see `storage.parseMemoryWorthCounterField` in PR 1) already
 *     strip negatives and non-integers, but the helper re-validates so it
 *     survives being called directly from tests / ad-hoc tooling.
 *   - Confidence is the effective number of observations (post-decay). PR 4
 *     and PR 5 use it to decide whether the Memory Worth multiplier should
 *     actually be applied vs. left at 1.0 (i.e., "not enough signal yet").
 *
 * Out of scope here:
 *   - Mutating frontmatter (PR 3).
 *   - Recall integration / feature flag (PR 4).
 *   - Benchmark & default-flip (PR 5).
