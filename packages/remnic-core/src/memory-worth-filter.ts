/**
 * Issue #560 PR 4 — Memory Worth recall filter.
 *
 * Pure helper that multiplies candidate recall scores by a Memory Worth
 * factor (from `computeMemoryWorth`, PR 2) so memories with a history of
 * failed sessions sink in the ranking. Reading the per-memory counters is
 * the caller's job — this module does no I/O and depends only on PR 2's
 * pure scorer.
 *
 * The filter is feature-flagged (`recallMemoryWorthFilterEnabled` on
 * PluginConfig, default `false` in this PR) so operators can A/B it safely
 * before PR 5 flips the default.
 *
 * Intentional properties:
 *   - Pure function. No side effects, no I/O. Tested directly.
 *   - Candidates with no counters (empty `counters` map entry) score exactly
 *     the same as they did pre-filter (multiplier = 0.5, but we renormalize
 *     so the neutral prior stays neutral — see the "neutral prior preserves
 *     ranking among unseen memories" test below).
 *   - Stable: a strictly sorted input stays in its original order among
 *     items that all score to the prior. This matters because an ad-hoc
 *     sort that returns 0 for ties on some comparators but not others
 *     produces non-deterministic ordering (CLAUDE.md rule 19).
 *   - Does not mutate inputs — returns a new array.
 *
 * How the multiplier is applied:
 *   `new_score = old_score * (p_success / PRIOR)`
 *   where PRIOR = 0.5. This way an uninstrumented memory (p_success = 0.5)
 *   gets a multiplier of exactly 1.0 (no penalty, no boost), a memory that
 *   always succeeds gets a multiplier approaching 2.0 (boosted) and a
 *   memory that always fails gets a multiplier approaching 0.0 (sunk).
 *   Using the ratio instead of raw `p_success` keeps the filter from
 *   accidentally halving every un-instrumented memory the moment it ships.
 *
 * Out of scope:
 *   - Reading counters from storage (caller does that once per recall).
 *   - Orchestrator wiring / config plumbing (separate commit in this PR).
 *   - Default flip to `true` (PR 5 once benchmark confirms a win).
