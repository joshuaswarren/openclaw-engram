/**
 * Reasoning-trace recall boost (issue #564 PR 3).

 * Pure helpers for:
 * - detecting whether a user query looks like a problem-solving ask
 *   ("how do I…", "step by step", etc.)
 * - boosting stored reasoning_trace memories within a result list when that
 *   condition matches.
 *
 * Callers gate these helpers behind the `recallReasoningTraceBoostEnabled`
 * config flag (default false); the helpers themselves are also no-ops when
 * `enabled` is false so they can be safely chained into the recall pipeline.

/**
 * Heuristic: does the incoming query read like the user wants a stored
 * solution chain (reasoning trace)?
 *
 * Positive signals:
 *  - starts with "how do I", "how can I", "how would I", "how to"
 *  - contains "step by step", "walk me through", "work through"
 *  - contains "reasoning", "think through", "figure out", "debug"
 *  - explicitly mentions "trace" or "chain of thought"
 *
 * This is intentionally conservative — the boost is OFF by default, so false
 * negatives are cheap, but false positives would shift retrieval for ordinary
 * queries on an opt-in install.

 * matching reasoning trace in place, then promotes each boosted trace
 * upward PAST any non-boosted neighbor whose score is strictly lower
 * than the trace's boosted score. Non-matching results keep their
 * incoming relative order — so reranker-driven path ordering and any
 * other upstream nudges on non-trace items are preserved. We do NOT
 * re-sort the full list, which would wipe out rerank priority on
 * non-trace items (whose numeric scores may have been left stale by the
 * rerank pass). This matters because MMR runs immediately after and
 * truncates to a topN window — globally re-sorting would silently drop
 * reranker-promoted items below the cutoff.

 * No-ops (returns a copy of the input unchanged) when:
 *  - `enabled` is false,

 * Note on legacy paths: this helper intentionally only matches paths
 * under the dedicated `reasoning-traces/` subtree introduced by PR 3.
 * Historical reasoning_trace memories (if any) written before that
 * subtree existed were routed to `facts/<date>/` and are NOT
 * boost-eligible. Operators upgrading across that boundary should run
 * the migration CLI or rewrite old paths before enabling the boost.
