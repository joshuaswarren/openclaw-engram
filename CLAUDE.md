## PUBLIC REPOSITORY — Privacy Policy

**This repository is PUBLIC on GitHub.** Every commit is visible to the world.

### Rules for ALL agents committing to this repo:

1. **NEVER commit personal data** — no names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, account IDs, or user identifiers
2. **NEVER commit API keys, tokens, or secrets** — even in comments or examples
3. **NEVER commit memory content** — the `facts/`, `entities/`, `corrections/`, `questions/`, `state/` directories contain user memories and must NEVER be committed
4. **NEVER commit IDENTITY.md or profile.md** — these contain personal behavioral profiles
5. **NEVER commit `.env` files** or any file containing credentials
6. **NEVER reference specific users, their preferences, or their data** in code comments or commit messages
7. **Config examples must use placeholders** — `${OPENAI_API_KEY}`, not actual keys
8. **Test data must be synthetic** — never use real conversation data in tests

### What IS safe to commit:
- Source code (`src/`, `scripts/`)
- Package manifests (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsup.config.ts`)
- Plugin manifest (`openclaw.plugin.json`)
- Documentation (`README.md`)
- Build configuration
- `.gitignore`
- This `CLAUDE.md` file

### Before every commit, verify:
- `git diff --cached` contains NO personal information
- No hardcoded API keys, URLs with tokens, or credentials
- No references to specific users or their data
