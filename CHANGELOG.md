## [Unreleased]

<!-- New items go here before they're released -->

### Changed
- PR #82 follow-up recall injection compatibility:
  - Return both `systemPrompt` and `prependContext` from `before_agent_start` so memory context is injected across gateway variants.
- PR #110 QMD daemon reliability and warm-path parity:
  - Replaced unreachable HTTP daemon transport with a managed stdio `qmd mcp` session.
  - Corrected daemon query tool/argument usage to `query` with `limit`.
  - Added daemon fast paths for BM25 and vector search to reduce cold subprocess latency.
  - Hardened subprocess parsing for `No results found.` outputs and preserved fail-open fallback behavior.
- PR #75 recall pipeline adaptation for current v8 main:
  - Added `recallBudgetChars` and ordered `recallPipeline` config contracts with per-section enable/limits and profile consolidation thresholds.
  - Refactored recall assembly to section-bucket ordering with section-level caps while preserving existing v8 retrieval semantics.
  - Launched transcript/summaries/conversation-recall/compounding section fetches in parallel with preamble retrieval while keeping pipeline-ordered final assembly.
  - Fixed profile consolidation target-line consistency by using dynamic target lines in gateway fallback schema and OpenAI prompt text.
  - Fixed knowledge-index override caching so per-call override requests do not reuse stale default-cache snapshots.
  - Added tests for recall pipeline config parsing/defaults, knowledge-index override cache behavior, and custom pipeline reorder/disable assembly behavior.
- v8.16 Task 5 hardening update:
  - Added a compounding-artifact review checklist to `docs/ops/pr-review-hardening-playbook.md` covering provenance integrity, advisory-only promotion contract, outcome-summary consistency, and duplicate parsing drift prevention.
- PR #57 work extraction boundary hardening:
  - Preserved linked work payload text containing wrapper-like tokens such as `[WORK_LAYER_CONTEXT link_to_memory=...]`.
  - Escaped wrapper opener/closer tokens during work-layer wrapping and restored them only after boundary cleanup.
  - Added regression coverage for metadata-like literal opener text in linked payloads.
- PR #42 review-hardening backfill for Cursor findings (PRs #37-#40):
  - Fixed continuity incident read-limit handling to guard `NaN` limits and to apply state filtering before result capping.
  - Fixed continuity incident close-path ID lookup to verify parsed frontmatter ID before using filename suffix matches.
  - Simplified continuity incident state parsing (removed redundant ternary branch).
  - Fixed identity anchor merge to always persist sentinel cleanup for existing sections.
  - Gated continuity-audit reference reads behind `continuityAuditEnabled` and bounded compounding incident scans.
  - Added regression tests for all above cases (storage, tools/CLI state filtering, compounding gate, anchor sentinel cleanup).
- PR #34 recall hardening + dedupe tooling:
  - Switched recall retrieval to daemon-preferred `search()` with bounded hybrid backfill to reduce contention and preserve fail-open behavior.
  - Kept `hybridSearch()` as BM25+vector diversification path (no daemon short-circuit), so backfill can broaden recall candidates.
  - Added graph-assist guardrails so full-mode graph expansion requires `multiGraphMemoryEnabled=true`.
  - Added bounded TMT summary input capping helpers to avoid oversized summarization payloads.
- PR #33 stability pass:
  - Fixed `buildRecallQueryPolicy` to preserve raw non-cron prompts (no whitespace normalization) when cron recall policy is not active.
  - Replaced cron prompt bullet/numbered-line regex scoring with deterministic parsing to avoid regex-risk findings on untrusted input.
  - Added regression coverage for raw-prompt preservation in non-cron and cron-policy-disabled paths.

  - Added stronger retrieval penalty for `verificationState: disputed`.
  - Added optional stale retrieval filtering (`lifecycleFilterStaleEnabled`) applied before final top-K cap.
  - Preserved fail-open behavior for legacy memories with no lifecycle metadata.
  - Added retrieval tests covering lifecycle weighting, stale filtering, and fail-open legacy behavior.

  - Added planner/config tests for graph-mode gating and opt-in parsing behavior.
- v8.2 PR 19B (graph-recall integration slice):
  - Added graph-mode recall expansion in `recallInternal`: when planner selects `graph_mode`, QMD seeds are expanded via `GraphIndex.spreadingActivation(...)`, merged/deduped with QMD candidates, then fed through existing boost/rerank/cap stages.
  - Added `state/last_graph_recall.json` trace output capturing graph recall mode, query hash/length, namespace scope, seed paths, and expanded candidates for explainability/debugging.

## [8.2.0-pr18] — v8.2 PR 18: Multi-Graph Memory

### Added
- Multi-graph memory (MAGMA/SYNAPSE-inspired, behind `multiGraphMemoryEnabled`, default off):
  - New `src/graph.ts`: maintains three typed edge graphs — entity co-reference (`entity.jsonl`), temporal sequence (`time.jsonl`), and causal inference (`causal.jsonl`) — stored under `memory/state/graphs/`.
  - **Entity graph**: edges written during `persistExtraction` when a new memory shares an `entityRef` with existing memories (capped at `maxEntityGraphEdgesPerMemory`, default 10).
  - **Time graph**: edges written between consecutive memories within the same conversation thread.
  - **Causal graph**: edges written when new memory content contains causal signal phrases (`because`, `therefore`, `led to`, `as a result`, `caused`, `because of`).
  - **Spreading activation** (`GraphIndex.spreadingActivation`): SYNAPSE-inspired BFS traversal from seed nodes across all enabled graph types with configurable per-hop decay. Ready for use by PR 19 (graph recall mode).
  - All graph writes are fail-open: any error is caught and logged; memory writes succeed regardless.
  - New config: `multiGraphMemoryEnabled`, `entityGraphEnabled`, `timeGraphEnabled`, `causalGraphEnabled`, `maxGraphTraversalSteps` (default 3), `graphActivationDecay` (default 0.7), `maxEntityGraphEdgesPerMemory` (default 10).

## [8.2.0-pr17] — v8.2 PR 17: Temporal Memory Tree

### Added
- Temporal Memory Tree (TiMem-inspired, behind `temporalMemoryTreeEnabled`, default off):
  - New `src/tmt.ts`: builds a hierarchy of summarised memory nodes — hour → day → week → persona — stored under `memory/tmt/` as markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
  - **Hour nodes** (`tmt/YYYY-MM-DD/hour-HH.md`): consolidated when `>= tmtHourlyMinMemories` new memories exist for that hour.
  - **Day nodes** (`tmt/YYYY-MM-DD/day.md`): built/updated from hour nodes during daily consolidation.
  - **Week nodes** (`tmt/week-YYYY-WW.md`): rolled up from day nodes when the ISO week turns.
  - **Persona node** (`tmt/persona.md`): synthesised from the 4 most recent week-node summaries.
  - **Recall injection**: the most temporally relevant TMT node is injected between Memory Boxes and QMD results when `temporalMemoryTreeEnabled=true`. Injection is skipped on `no_recall`/`minimal` planner modes.
  - Uses existing `LocalLlmClient` for summarisation via a callback — no additional API cost by default.
  - All node writes are fail-open: errors are caught and logged; consolidation and recall continue regardless.
  - New config: `temporalMemoryTreeEnabled` (default `false`), `tmtHourlyMinMemories` (default `3`), `tmtSummaryMaxTokens` (default `300`).

- `.editorconfig` for consistent cross-editor formatting
- `.nvmrc` and `.node-version` pinning Node to 22

- `eslint.config.js` for editor ESLint integration (ignores `dist/`, primary gate remains `tsc --noEmit`)
- `Makefile` with `make test`, `make build`, `make check` targets
- `.cursorignore` to exclude generated/build artifacts from Cursor indexing
- `llms.txt` — machine-readable project summary for AI assistants

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/tech-stack.md`, `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, `docs/api.md`, `docs/requirements/README.md`
- `tests/fixtures/` directory with synthetic test fixtures

## [8.1.0] - 2026-02-22

> Plan codename: **v8.1 — Intent + Temporal Indexing** (PR #15)

### Added
- Query-aware indexing (SwiftMem-inspired, behind `queryAwareIndexingEnabled`, default off):
  - New `src/temporal-index.ts`: maintains `state/index_time.json` (date buckets → memory paths) and `state/index_tags.json` (frontmatter tags → memory paths) after each extraction.
  - Adaptive retrieval prefilter: temporal queries receive a +0.08 score boost; `#tag` tokens in the prompt receive a +0.06 score boost. Additive and fail-open — index absence never breaks recall.
  - Batch indexing runs fire-and-forget after extraction to avoid blocking the write path.
  - New config: `queryAwareIndexingEnabled`, `queryAwareIndexingMaxCandidates`.

## [8.0.3] - 2026-02-22

> Plan codename: **v8.0 Phase 2C — Docs IA Overhaul** (PR #14)

### Added
- Docs IA overhaul foundation:
  - Rewrote `README.md` to be short (value prop, quick install, 5-minute setup, docs table).
  - New `docs/getting-started.md` — install, QMD setup, 5-minute config, verification.
  - New `docs/operations.md` — backup/export, CLI, hourly summaries, file hygiene, logs.
  - New `docs/config-reference.md` — single source of truth for all config flags and defaults.
  - New `docs/architecture/overview.md` — system design, components, storage layout, frontmatter schema.
  - New `docs/architecture/retrieval-pipeline.md` — full retrieval pipeline diagram and stage descriptions.
  - New `docs/architecture/memory-lifecycle.md` — write path, consolidation, expiry, dedup, box lifecycle, HiMem.
  - Updated `docs/README.md` to reflect the new IA with links to all new docs.

## [8.0.2] - 2026-02-22

> Plan codename: **v8.0 Phase 2B — Episode/Note Dual Store (HiMem)** (PR #13)

### Added
- Experimental Episode/Note dual store (HiMem, all behind config flags, default off):
  - **Episode/Note classification** (`episodeNoteModeEnabled`): each extracted memory is tagged with `memoryKind: episode` (time-specific event) or `memoryKind: note` (stable belief, preference, decision, constraint). Uses heuristic signals (temporal language, stable-belief keywords, tags, category).
  - New config: `episodeNoteModeEnabled`.

## [8.0.1] - 2026-02-22

> Plan codename: **v8.0 Phase 2A — Memory Boxes + Trace Weaving** (PR #12)

### Added
- Experimental Memory Boxes + Trace Weaving (all behind config flags, default off):
  - **Memory Boxes** (`memoryBoxesEnabled`): groups extracted memories into topic-bounded windows stored in `memory/boxes/YYYY-MM-DD/box-<id>.md`. Boxes seal on topic shift, time gap, or max-memory count.
  - **Trace Weaving** (`traceWeaverEnabled`): assigns a shared `traceId` to boxes that repeatedly revisit the same topic cluster, enabling cross-session topic continuity.
  - Recall injection: recent topic windows appear as `## Recent Topic Windows` section after verbatim artifacts when `memoryBoxesEnabled=true`.
  - New config: `boxTopicShiftThreshold`, `boxTimeGapMs`, `boxMaxMemories`, `traceWeaverLookbackDays`, `traceWeaverOverlapThreshold`, `boxRecallDays`.

## [8.0.0] - 2026-02-22

> Plan codename: **v8.0 Phase 1 — Memory OS Core** (PR #11)

### Added
- Experimental memory-os capabilities (all behind config flags, default off):
  - Recall planner (`recallPlannerEnabled`) to choose `no_recall` / `minimal` / `full` / `graph_mode`.
  - Intent-grounded memory routing metadata (`intentGoal`, `intentActionType`, `intentEntityTypes`) with configurable ranking boost.
  - Verbatim artifact persistence + recall injection (`memoryDir/artifacts/**`) for quote-first anchors.
  - New docs entrypoint: `docs/README.md` for the docs reorganization rollout.
- npm-first distribution + release automation:
  - New `Release and Publish` workflow (`.github/workflows/release-and-publish.yml`) that runs on `main` merges, verifies quality gates, bumps version, tags, creates GitHub release, and publishes to npm.
  - Package publish metadata in `package.json`: `engines.node`, `prepack`, and `publishConfig` (`access: public`, `provenance: true`).
  - npm package name scoped to `@joshuaswarren/openclaw-engram`.
- Contributor onboarding and contribution governance docs:
  - New `CONTRIBUTING.md` with standards for issues/PRs, testing, changelog policy, and AI-assisted contributions.
  - New `CONTRIBUTORS.md` with contributor recognition.
  - New GitHub issue templates for bug reports and feature requests.
  - New pull request template with validation and risk checklist.
- Changelog/release process automation:
  - `Changelog Guard` workflow requiring `CHANGELOG.md` updates for source/config/plugin changes (with `skip-changelog` maintainer bypass label).
  - `Release Drafter` workflow + config for automated draft release notes from merged PRs.
  - `Review Thread Guard` workflow that fails PR checks when active review threads are unresolved.
  - Release Drafter autolabeling adjusted so `src/**` changes no longer auto-label as `feature` (avoids accidental minor version bumps for fixes/refactors).
- GitHub Actions quality and security checks for pull requests:
  - `CI` (typecheck, tests, build on Node 22/24)
  - `Dependency Review` (blocks high+ severity dependency risks)
  - `Secret Scan` (Gitleaks on PRs and main pushes)
  - `CodeQL` analysis (PR + weekly schedule)
- `AI Review Gate` workflow requiring review activity from KiloConnect, Codex, and Cursor Bugbot bot groups before merge.

### Changed
- Extraction persistence now infers and stores intent metadata per memory/chunk, enabling intent-compatible recall boosts when enabled.
- Recall assembly now supports optional artifact section injection and planner-driven QMD result caps in minimal mode.
- `no_recall` now short-circuits before preamble fetches (shared context/profile/knowledge index), avoiding unnecessary reads and injection on acknowledgement turns.
- Artifact recall now honors minimal planner caps via `computeArtifactRecallLimit(...)`.
- Intent planner/inference now safely handle non-string/nullish runtime inputs without throwing.
- Embedding fallback recall paths now apply the same `boostSearchResults` ranking stage as primary QMD recall.
- `no_recall` planner mode now hard-sets `recallResultLimit=0` for stronger path-safety invariants.
- Release automation hardening:
  - Protected-branch-safe flow: sync + validate latest `origin/main`, compute next version from tags, create a local release commit (not pushed to `main`), tag that commit, push only the release tag, then create GitHub release and publish to npm.
  - Release tags are annotated tags; annotated tags include `source-main-sha` metadata for idempotency.
  - npm publish uses npm trusted publishing (OIDC via GitHub Actions) instead of `NPM_TOKEN` secrets.
  - Next-version tag discovery ignores non-`vX.Y.Z` tags to avoid malformed version parsing.
- Node version alignment with OpenClaw: `engines.node` is now `>=22.12.0`.
- Installation docs now lead with `openclaw plugins install @joshuaswarren/openclaw-engram --pin`.
- `agent_end` ingestion now ignores non-`user`/`assistant` message roles.
- Recall keeps fail-open headroom: hard recall guard reduced to 75s to stay above QMD worst cases.

### Fixed
- Runtime hardening for missing QMD collections: disables retrieval features when collections are confirmed absent, treats transient failures as `unknown`.
- Recall timeout/failure logs throttled to reduce warning spam.
- Conversation-index paths now use their own availability flag independent of primary `qmdEnabled`.

## [7.2.4] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- Fail-open recall improvements + missing QMD collection guards.

## [7.2.3] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- npm package scoped to `@joshuaswarren/openclaw-engram`; trusted OIDC publishing configured.

## [7.2.2] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Release pipeline workflow parser failure; version split uses shell parameter expansion.

## [7.2.1] - 2026-02-19

### Added

  - `localLlmApiKey`, `localLlmHeaders`, `localLlmAuthHeader`
  - `qmdPath` override for explicit QMD binary pathing

- Regression tests for local LLM abort handling/retry behavior.

### Changed
- Local LLM requests now include operation-aware diagnostics (`op=...`) in timeout/error logs for faster incident triage.
- Extraction/profile/identity/consolidation/hourly-summary/entity-summary local calls now pass explicit operation names for attributed logs.

### Fixed
- Local LLM abort timeouts are now treated as transient: retry with backoff and do not mark local endpoint unavailable immediately.
- Added gateway fallback paths for consolidation/profile/identity JSON parsing when local LLM fails, reducing dropped maintenance passes.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- Optional file hygiene (off by default):

  - Rotate oversized markdown files into `archiveDir`, replacing the original with a lean index plus a small tail excerpt.
  - Config: `fileHygiene.*`

## [2.2.5] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- Reduced background extraction crashes by defensively skipping malformed entity payloads.
- Improved structured JSON extraction from LLM outputs when responses contain multiple JSON blocks.
- Reduced QMD update/embed flakiness by serializing QMD CLI calls within the process and retrying on transient SQLite lock errors.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Prevented background extraction crashes when local LLM entity output omits or malforms `entities[].facts`.

### Changed
- Hourly summary cron auto-registration now targets `sessionTarget: "isolated"` with `payload.kind: "agentTurn"`.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Disagreement heuristic (suggestion-only): when the user pushes back, Engram injects a short helper section encouraging use of `memory_last_recall` and (optionally) `memory_feedback_last_recall`. Never records negative examples automatically.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Negative examples (retrieved-but-not-useful) feedback loop (opt-in):
  - Config: `negativeExamplesEnabled`, `negativeExamplesPenaltyPerHit`, `negativeExamplesPenaltyCap`
  - Storage: `memoryDir/state/negative_examples.json`
- Last recall snapshot + impression log for debugging/feedback workflows:
  - Storage: `memoryDir/state/last_recall.json`, `memoryDir/state/recall_impressions.jsonl`
  - Tools: `memory_last_recall`, `memory_feedback_last_recall`

### Changed
- Signal scan now treats phrases like "that's not right" / "why did you say that" as high-signal.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- Documentation clarified: `rerankProvider: "cloud"` is reserved/experimental and currently treated as a no-op.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Advanced retrieval controls (disabled by default):
  - Heuristic query expansion (`queryExpansionEnabled`, `queryExpansionMaxQueries`, `queryExpansionMinTokenLen`)
  - Optional LLM re-ranking (`rerankEnabled`, `rerankProvider`, `rerankMaxCandidates`, `rerankTimeoutMs`, caching)
  - Optional feedback capture tool (`feedbackEnabled`, `memory_feedback`) stored locally and applied as a soft ranking bias
- Documentation: `docs/advanced-retrieval.md`

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Configurable local LLM hard timeout (`localLlmTimeoutMs`, default 180000ms).
- Optional slow query logging (`slowLogEnabled`, `slowLogThresholdMs`) for local LLM + QMD operations.

### Changed
- Reduced default log verbosity for local LLM model listings.
- QMD failures now include a concise error string and are backoff-suppressed.

### Fixed
- Model context budgeting now clamps output/input to avoid negative input budgets.
- TypeScript typecheck/build issues across CLI, extraction salvage, and plugin SDK typings.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Access Tracking (Phase 1A)**: Track memory access counts and recency
  - New frontmatter fields: `accessCount`, `lastAccessed`
  - Batched updates flushed during consolidation (zero retrieval latency)
  - Configurable via `accessTrackingEnabled`, `accessTrackingBufferMaxSize`
- **Local Importance Scoring (Phase 1B)**: Zero-LLM heuristic importance
  - New `importance` field with score (0-1), level, reasons, keywords
  - Pattern-based scoring for critical/high/normal/low/trivial content
  - Category-based boosts (corrections +0.15, principles +0.12, etc.)
  - Keyword extraction for improved search relevance
  - Importance used for ranking boost, not exclusion (quality safeguard)
- **Recency Boosting**: Recent memories ranked higher in search results
  - Configurable `recencyWeight` (0-1, default 0.2)
  - Exponential decay with 7-day half-life
- **Access Count Boosting**: Frequently accessed memories surface higher
  - Log-scale boost capped at 0.1 to prevent runaway effects
  - Configurable via `boostAccessCount`
- **Status Field**: New `status` field for lifecycle management
  - Values: `active` (default), `superseded`, `archived`
  - Non-active memories filtered from default retrieval
- CLI: `engram access`, `engram flush-access`, `engram importance`
- **Automatic Chunking (Phase 2A)**: Sentence-boundary chunking for long memories
  - New frontmatter fields: `parentId`, `chunkIndex`, `chunkTotal`
  - Configurable target tokens (default 200) and overlap (default 2 sentences)
  - Disabled by default, enable with `chunkingEnabled: true`
- CLI: `engram chunks`
- **Contradiction Detection (Phase 2B)**: LLM-verified contradiction resolution
  - Auto-resolve when confidence > 0.9 (configurable)
  - Full audit trail via `status: superseded` and correction entries
  - Disabled by default, enable with `contradictionDetectionEnabled: true`
- **Memory Linking (Phase 3A)**: Build knowledge graph between memories
  - Link types: follows, references, contradicts, supports, related
  - Disabled by default, enable with `memoryLinkingEnabled: true`
- **Conversation Threading (Phase 3B)**: Group memories into threads
  - Auto-detect thread boundaries (session change or 30min gap)
  - Threads stored in `threads/` directory
  - Disabled by default, enable with `threadingEnabled: true`
- CLI: `engram threads`
- **Memory Summarization (Phase 4A)**: Compress old memories into summaries
  - Triggered when memory count exceeds threshold (default 1000)
  - Archives source memories (`status: archived`)
  - Summaries stored in `summaries/` directory
  - Disabled by default, enable with `summarizationEnabled: true`
- **Topic Extraction (Phase 4B)**: TF-IDF topic analysis
  - Topics stored in `state/topics.json`
  - Enabled by default
- CLI: `engram topics`, `engram summaries`

### Changed
- Retrieval now filters out non-active memories by default
- Plan updated to v1.2 with quality safeguards

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- LLM trace callback system (`LlmTraceEvent`) for external observability plugins
- Expose orchestrator via `globalThis.__openclawEngramOrchestrator` for inter-plugin discovery
- Token usage reporting on all LLM calls
- CHANGELOG.md

### Changed
- Entity extraction now injects known entity names to reduce fragmentation
- Fuzzy entity matching prevents duplicate entity files
- Profile dedup uses normalized string comparison instead of exact match
- Entity aliases moved from hardcoded source to configurable `config/aliases.json`
- All code examples use generic placeholders (no personal data)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- Initial release: GPT-5.2 extraction, QMD hybrid search, markdown storage
- 10 memory categories: fact, preference, correction, entity, decision, relationship, principle, commitment, moment, skill
